Solo Exercise: User Interface
60 minutes
Welcome to Handshake! Your technical exercises today will comprise a gradually growing codebase, starting from the foundation you built in the take-home portion. Bear in mind as you work that you're going to be responsible for maintaining this codebase all day â€“ plan ahead!
Exercise
In your take-home exercise, you built a model and the networking required to fill it out. Today, you'll start by putting that model into an interface. Please build a scrolling list populated with the models your networking layer retrieves from the endpoint you used in the previous exercise. Each cell in the list should show the job title, the name of the employer, and the employer's logo. There should also be a favorite button, which you don't need to hook up right now. (Note: since the API doesn't have employer images yet, please use an empty image view as a placeholder.)

You'll also need to build a detail view that you'll navigate to when the user taps on a cell in the scrolling list. The detail view should show the same information and image as the list cell, as well as that non-functional favorite button. It should also have the job description. Additionally, there should be some formatted data: please add the contact's name, the job's location, and the job's salary, all formatted appropriately.

We know this is a lot to do in an hour! Don't panic, okay? If you don't finish everything, it won't count against you. Just be ready to talk about how you chose which pieces to do, and which to skip.
Resources
We're providing rough wireframes for what these views might look like. You're absolutely welcome to use them, or to create your own layout. Neither choice will count against you.

If at any point you have questions about the exercise, feel free to ask your Handshake engineering contact. This also will not count against you. We're here to set you up for success,   so please take advantage!
